# **KAGGLE-PROJECT**

## **Welcome to the Kaggle Project Repository**

This repository is dedicated to various Kaggle competitions and demonstrate my skills in machine learning with Python. Here, I explore key machine learning concepts, experiment with innovative and original approaches, and demonstrate my skills in tackling diverse data science challenges.

### **Structure of the Repository**

Here are the different thematics :  
- Classification
- Regression
- Computer Vision
- Natural Language Processing
- And more to come

Each subfolder corresponds to a different competition theme. Within these folders, you will find a dedicated `README.md` file that explains:
- The objective of the competition
- The unique strategies or methods I used to solve the problem
- Insights gained and key learning points

Whether you're here to learn, explore, or contribute, I hope this repository provides valuable insights into practical machine learning on Kaggle!
